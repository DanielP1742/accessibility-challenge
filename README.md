# Code Refactor Starter Code Assignment

In this project I was given starter code and was tasked with cleaning it up(Scouts Rule), removing any redundant code, update it for accessiblity standards & provide any fixes. The site had to be fully functional at the end of the project as well.

## What I did:

### Cleaning it up:

- I added comments to the CSS so that it became clear where the stylings where applied too.  Increase readablity
- I added Semantic Elements of header, article, aside & footer to cleaning up the sections.  Increase readablity

### Removing DRY code:

- I combined a lot of the CSS classes to make the CSS not so repeative.  

### Accessiblity:

- I added alt "" to the images that where not functional soley decorative.
- I decided I did want an alt with the hero.  I wasn't sure how to do this because the img was stored in CSS not HTML.  After researching it I found a way with using the span element  
    I refereded this website and placed the alt in a span element: https://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html

### General Fixes 

- I fixed the a link in the nav bar.  One of the links did not bring the page to desired labeled sections.  It was missing a "id"  Functionalbity fix. 

## How it went:

Overal I think the assignment went well.  I'm still unsure if I labeled the alt element in hero correctly but otherwise I'm pretty confident in all the other work.  Great first project.  The site is better then how I found it.
